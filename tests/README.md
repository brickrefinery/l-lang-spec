# L Test Files

This folder contains a colletion of test files that can be used to test an implementation of L.

Each file should be in a pair:

* Test File
  * \<some test\>.ldr : this file can be read as an L file (or opened in stud.io for review) that demostrates some specific property of the language.
* Output File
  * \<some test\>-output.ldr : this is the expected output of the above test file.
